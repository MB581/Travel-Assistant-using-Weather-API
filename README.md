# 🌍 Travel Assistant using Weather API  

>## 🔍 Introduction  
>>Traveling is an exciting experience, but it also comes with challenges, particularly when it comes to unpredictable weather conditions, health concerns, and safety risks. Travelers often face difficulties in assessing the impact of weather on their journey, which can lead to discomfort, disruptions, or even health hazards.<br>

To address this issue, we have developed an **AI-powered Travel Assistant** that provides real-time weather updates, health risk advisories, and travel safety recommendations. By leveraging **n8n**, an automation workflow tool, and the **OpenWeatherMap API**, the assistant processes and delivers **personalized travel insights** to users.<br>  
This system ensures that travelers are well-informed about the environmental conditions of their destination, allowing them to plan their trip efficiently and minimize unexpected complications.

## 🚀 How It Works  
This Travel Assistant is powered by **n8n**, which automates the process of fetching, analyzing, and delivering travel insights. The workflow functions as follows:  

1️⃣ **User Input:** The traveler provides the system with a **destination** and **date** for their trip.  
2️⃣ **Weather Data Retrieval:** The assistant fetches **real-time weather details** using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
3️⃣ **Data Processing & Analysis:** The AI analyzes key weather parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast predictions.  
4️⃣ **Health & Safety Assessment:** The system evaluates potential health risks and generates safety recommendations based on current weather conditions.  
5️⃣ **Email Notification:** A detailed **email is sent** to the traveler, summarizing all the relevant insights, precautions, and recommendations.  

The **automated workflow** ensures that users get real-time weather assistance without the need for manual searches or multiple app installations.
